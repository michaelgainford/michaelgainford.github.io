## About Me

  Hi! 👋🏻 My name is Michael. I am a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js. I am always looking to learn new things and improve my skills. I am currently working on a project to create a website that will act as a hub for all things web development. So, grab a ☕, get comfortable in your 🪑 and let's go! 🚀

## Overview

  The purpose of this site is to act as a single hub for all things web development. It will contain a list of resources, projects, and other helpful information for web developers. The site will be built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, on the Next.js framework. The site will be fully responsive and accessible, and will be optimized for performance.
