## About Me

  Hi! 👋🏻 My name is Michael. I am a Frontend Developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites and generally just writing code. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js (as well as other languages). I am always looking to learn new things and improve my skills and am combining passions of mine with latest coding technologies to create something special. So, grab a ☕, get comfortable in your 🪑 and let's 🚀!

## Overview

  The purpose of this site is to act as a single hub for all things web development. It contains a raft of personal projects based on interests, tools, and other helpful information and resources for web developers - and hopefully some inspiration can be taken. The site is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
