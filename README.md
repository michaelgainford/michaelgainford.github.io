# michaelgainford.dev

This is my online development website. I hope to be able to include tens, leading to hundreds, of projects on this site. This is essentially my development area, where everything I build goes, with my portfolio website retained for what I deem to be the select pick of my total portfolio.

Think of my portfolio as my house, with nice things on show, whilst my .dev website is my shed, loft, basement etc.

My portfolio website is located at https://michaelgainford.co.uk.
